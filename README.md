## Introduction

Jet-Black is an non-profit open source project that provides access to multiple platforms and a set of apis for consuming different types of media content - namely manga, anime, fictions, and others.

At first, this project was just an ambitious and glorified side-gig time waster. It served for the purposes of learning and experimenting with cool new tools and systems. However as time went on, we realized that this project and what it aims to become might of interest to someone - be it a developer who also wants to contribute, a developer who wants to use our apis for their app, or just someone who wants to consume content on our platforms.

The project is still **very** early in development phase, and perhaps we are getting way ahead of ourselves with this readme, but we have high hopes and are very excited to see what will become of Jet-Black.

## Why does Jet-Black exist ?

Although there are already countless such content steaming platforms out there, we over at Azure-Blade feel like Jet-Black deserves a spot in the limelight.

Nowadays, most of the content that is available is either rightfully locked behind a subscription paywall, or pirated away by illegal means that allow illegitimate entities to seemingly give away this content for free, but in reality end up littering every step of the way with ad-laden and redirect-riddled experiences.

Jet-Black's ideals fall under the latter, but they are bit nobler. We scrape the content from the pirates themselves, and offer it to our users without the nasty practices the pirates do - such as the aforementioned advertisements and redirects.

**Make no mistake**, We are NOT promoting pirating - not at all.

In fact we implore you - if you can afford to, go and get a subscription from a legitimate streaming platform for the content you consume. By doing so, you are directly supporting the authors, creators and studios that pour blood, sweat, tears and so much effort into making the stuff that makes your heart flutter.

For the rest of you who aren't able to do that - **Jet-Black** is here for you <3

As long as we aren't taken down, Jet-Black will continue to provide users with a means to enjoy their favorite content type advertisement and redirect free.

### _*Side-note*_:

To avoid possible trouble, Jet-Black does **NOT** store any content/media information - only metadata about it.
